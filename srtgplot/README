srtgplot v0.1
=============
Copyright(c) 2010 Arun Viswanathan 

srtgplot is a simple tool to plot real-time timestamped data using gnuplot. 
The real-time data can be generated using any command, program or script. 
Data is expected to be either numeric or continuous and the graph 
plotted is a simple timeline. Various configuration options are available and 
are specified using a simple configuration file in the format explained below.
Example configurations are available under the configs/ directory.

Usage
=====
    ./srtgplot.py --conf <config_file> [--help] [--logdir <logdirectory>]
    where
        config_file   : Configuration file in the format explained below.
        log_directory : Directory where captured data is stored. Files under
                        this directory will be of the format 
                        rtplot_<section_name_from_conf_file>_<randomstring>                              

Dependencies
============
    Depends on the dateutil package available from http://labix.org/python-dateutil
    Under Ubuntu, this can be easily installed using
        sudo apt-get install python-dateutil
    

Format of configuration file:
=============================
The configuration consists of sections, where each section defines
a separate plot. Plot parameters are defined using a set of keywords.
The file format is as follows:
 [ section-name ]
    key1 = value1
    key2 = value2
    ...
    ...
 Section names could be anything and the list of keywords is defined below.
 The keyword 'command' is mandatory and everything else has a default value.
 
Keywords Available
------------------
 command (mandatory)
   Any command that outputs a single line in the following format
   <time> <value>
   where
       time  : time in the format specified using the 'format' keyword 
               IMPORTANT: time cannot contain spaces.          
       value : real-valued or numerical value of the plotted variable   
           
 title (default: "Real-time plot")
   The title of the plot

 miny (default: 0)
   Minimum y-value
 
 maxy (default: * (suitable maximum))
   Maximum y-value
 
 frequency (default: 1)
   Frequency of updating output in seconds.
 
 showplot (default: 1)
   If showplot = 1, a gnuplot display is launched showing the realtime plot
   If showplot = 0, the gnuplot display is disabled but the values are
   still logged into the log file.

 plotwindow (default: 100 seconds)
   Specifies the width of the time window (in seconds) over which the 
   values are shown

 timeformat (default: %H:%M:%S)
   The format of time output by the command
   The following formatting options are available (same as gnuplot except %E)
       %a  abbreviated name of day of the week
       %A  full name of day of the week
       %b or %h    abbreviated name of the month
       %B  full name of the month
       %d  day of the month, 01–31
       %k  hour, 0–23 (one or two digits)
       %H  hour, 00–23 (always two digits)
       %l  hour, 1–12 (one or two digits)
       %I  hour, 01–12 (always two digits)
       %j  day of the year, 1–366
       %m  month, 01–12
       %M  minute, 0–60
       %p  "am" or "pm"
       %S  second, 0–60
       %U  week of the year (week starts on Sunday)
       %w  day of the week, 0–6 (Sunday = 0)
       %W  week of the year (week starts on Monday)
       %y  year, 0-99
       %Y  year, 4-digit
       %E  Unix Epoch
 
 processdata (default: 'raw')
    Allows different types of processing to be applied to the data before plotting.
    Currently available options are 'raw' and 'reld'.
    
    raw : Plots data without any processing
    reld : Plots the relative difference of values  
   
 enabled (default: 1)
    Enables or disables a section in a configuration file. 
    
 offline (default: None)
    Offline allows replotting from captured data. The argument to offline is 
    treated as the filename to plot from.
